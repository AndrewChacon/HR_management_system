# Jan 11 Sun
My goal for today is creating documentation for how I want to develop this project with a security first approach. The first part includes planning how I want to structure this application, as well as think about who this platform will serve, what problems it attempts to solve for them, all while maintaining a strong focus on what assets we must prioritize protecting. 
Im aiming to have a functional prototype of the platform developed in about 7 days, I believe this is pretty doable if I remember to keep a tight focus on the scope of the project.
